Hey there reader!
I'm blogging here to write about my journey in learning Data Science. I've taken a few classes on Datacamp in the past, but have now enrolled in Lambda School's Part Time Data Science track to fast track my career transitionÂ :)
I currently work in the energy industry as an integrity / corrosion engineer and have always been fascinated with ways to identify trends in data. A-lot-of-casual-reading-on-the-internet-time later, I decided to take up the challenge of learning programming and data analysis. I'm hoping to post interesting posts on my data analysis in the near future, so stay tuned!
